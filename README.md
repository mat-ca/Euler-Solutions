# Euler-Solutions
Discussion and introductory solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) for problems 1 to 20.

>The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.
